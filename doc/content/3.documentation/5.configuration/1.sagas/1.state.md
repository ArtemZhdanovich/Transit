# State

States represent previously consumed events resulting in an instance being in a current _state_. An instance can only be in one state at a given time. A new
instance defaults to the `Initial` state, which is automatically defined. The `Final` state is also defined for all state machines and is used to signify the
instance has reached the final state.

## Declaring States

In the example, two states are declared. States are automatically initialized by the `MassTransitStateMachine` base class constructor.

```csharp
public class OrderState : SagaStateMachineInstance
{
    /// <inheritdoc />
    public Guid CorrelationId { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// the current saga state
    /// </summary>
    public string CurrentState { get; set; }
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    // public State Initial { get; private set; } 
    public State Submitted { get; private set; } = null!;
    public State Accepted { get; private set; } = null!;
    // public State Final { get; private set; } 
}
```

## Configuring States

States don't need much in the way of configuring besides telling the state machine where to store the current state on the model.

```csharp
public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public State Submitted { get; private set; } = null!;

    public OrderStateMachine() 
    {
        // Tell the saga where to store the current state
        InstanceState(x => x.CurrentState);
    }
}
```
