# Events

An event is something that happened which may result in a state change. An event can add or update instance data, as well as changing an instance's current
state. The `Event<T>` is generic, where `T` must be a valid message type.

## Declaring Events

In the example below, the _SubmitOrder_ message is declared as an event including how to correlate the event to an instance.

> Unless events implement `CorrelatedBy<Guid>`, they must be declared with a correlation expression.

```csharp
public record SubmitOrder(Guid OrderId);

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public Event<SubmitOrder> SubmitOrder { get; private set; }
}
```

## Configuring Events

```csharp
public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public Event<SubmitOrder> SubmitOrder { get; private set; } = null!;

    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Event(
            () => SubmitOrder, 
            e => e.CorrelateById(cxt => cxt.Message.OrderId)
        );
    }
}
```

### Setting the Saga Factory

On events that are in the `Initial` state, a new instance of the saga will be
created. You can use the `SetSagaFactory` to control how the saga is instantiated.

```csharp
public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public Event<SubmitOrder> SubmitOrder { get; private set; } = null!;

    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Event(
            () => SubmitOrder, 
            e => 
            {
                e.CorrelateById(cxt => cxt.Message.OrderId)
                e.SetSagaFactory(cxt =>
                {
                    return new OrderState 
                    {
                        CorrelationId = cxt.Message.Instance 
                    };
                });
            }
            
        );
    }
}
```
