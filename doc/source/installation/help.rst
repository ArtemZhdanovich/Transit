Getting hold of us
==================

Getting ahold of the gang behind MassTransit is pretty straight forward, we try
to help as much as time permits and have tried to streamline this process as much
as possible.

But before you grab hold of us, spend a moment composing your thoughts and
formulate your question, there is nothing as pointless as simply telling us
"MassTransit does not work for me" with no further information to give any clue
to why.

And before you even do that, do a couple of searches to see if your question is
already answered, if it has been, you will get your answer much faster that way.

Mailing list
""""""""""""

Getting on or off our mailinglist happens through Google Groups.

 http://groups.google.com/group/masstransit-discuss/

If you are going to use MassTransit, subscribing to our ``masstransit-discuss``
mailing list is probably a very good idea.  This is where most conversation
about MassTransit is going to happen.

Make sure to pick a good subject line, and if the subject of the
thread changes, please change the subject to match, some of us deal
with hundreds of emails per day, after spam-filters, and we need all
the help we can get to pick the interesting ones.

Also, please include the diagnostics output generated by the code below.
This will help jump start a lot of the context for us.

.. sourcecode:: csharp

  var a = Bus.Factory.CreateUsingInMemory(cfg =>
          {

          });

  var result = a.GetProbeResult();
  var output = cc.ToJsonString();
  System.IO.File.WriteAllText("probe.txt", output);

Sample output
'''''''''''''

Twitter
"""""""

The most immediate way to get hold of us, is to shoot a tweet to ``#mtproj``

Our main time zone is Central time in the United States.

If you can explain your problem in a clear sentence, twitter is a good way
to get quick response. If you do need to paste log files, config and so on,
please use a ``gist``. But because its often not clear because usually
there is a great deal of context to a question we may push you to our mailing
list on google groups.

If twitter is all quiet, try the mailing list as well, we do have lives,
families and jobs to deal with also.


Issues / tickets
""""""""""""""""

Please do not open an issue on github, unless you have spotted an actual
bug in MassTransit.  Ask on the mailing list  first if you are in doubt.

 https://github.com/masstransit/masstransit/issues

The reason for this policy, is to avoid the bugs being drowned in a
pile of sensible suggestions for future enhancements and call for help
from people who forget to check back if they get it and so on.
